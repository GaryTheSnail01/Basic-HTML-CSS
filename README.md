# HTML Content Project

This is a showcase of my understanding of basic HTML elements & CSS. What I've added is a contact form with the contact page, a table showing inventory of the grocery store, as well as a beautiful picture of Gary The Snail. CSS was applied using the <style> section within the <head> section.
